	<h2>Hi! i'm evelyn</h2>
	<p>
		i'm an engineer currently based in Somerville, MA. Defining exactly what i do is hard, but it
		typically falls into the electrical/firmware sphere. i also have fairly extensive experience
		designing electric vehicle batteries. My passion is finding the simplicity in complex
		distributed systems and delivering a product that "just works". Someday, perhaps, i will
		actually execute on this beautiful vision...
	</p>
	<p>
		During the day (and sometimes also the night), i work at <a href="https://agzen.com">AgZen</a> building
		computer vision systems to help farmers spray less pesticides.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are a few fun projects <a href="/projects">here</a>, and a few more on my <a href="https://github.com/amrelk">GitHub</a>.
