In A term of 2022 (hence the name), i designed a fun little BLDC motor controller for an independent study project. The
idea was to make something that could theoretically compete with the hordes of cheap ESCs out there but also do real
sensored control and not suck at low speeds. This was a very fun project, and taught me a lot about designing tiny PCBs.
Unfortunately, i got busy building more complicated projects (primarily seen [here](/projects/fsae22) and
[here](/projects/fsae24)), and never got around to writing the firmware. i'm still convinced that if i dug up the box
it's in somewhere that i could get it to spin but who knows.

The source KiCad files can be found [here](https://github.com/amrelk/a22verter) for the curious.
